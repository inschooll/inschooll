This research project focuses on the development of a web application designed to assist the Student Disciplinary Council (SDC) in managing their responsibilities, with a primary focus on efficiently handling cases of students appearing before the council for disciplinary issues within and outside the school premises. The objective of this project is to streamline the workflow of the SDC, enhance transparency, and facilitate the management of disciplinary cases, ultimately contributing to a more effective disciplinary process.

To address this issue, the methodology employed involved a thorough analysis of the existing processes and systems within the SDC. This analysis served as the foundation for the design and implementation of the web application, taking into consideration the specific needs and requirements of the SDC. The application was developed with user-friendly interfaces and features that enable the council to log and track cases, manage student records, schedule hearings, and communicate with relevant parties involved in the disciplinary process.

The implementation of this web application has yielded significant results, including improved case management, enhanced data accuracy, and reduced administrative burden on the SDC members. The application also supports real-time communication and collaboration among council members, administrators, and involved students. Moreover, the application serves as a valuable repository of information, facilitating data analysis and reporting.

Key findings from this research reveal a notable increase in the efficiency of the SDC's operations, quicker resolution of disciplinary cases, and a more transparent and organized process. The implementation of this web application offers a promising avenue for educational institutions to strengthen their disciplinary processes.

In conclusion, this research project recommends the adoption of the web application by educational institutions with disciplinary councils to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in managing disciplinary matters. The application's user-friendly design and functionalities make it a valuable tool for promoting discipline and maintaining a safe and conducive learning environment.
